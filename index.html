            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>• Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which Udai Singh ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh.</li>
                <li>• His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had 2 stepsisters : Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. He was married to Maharani Ajabde Punwar of Bijolia Amar Singh.</li>
                <li>• After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the Sisodia Rajputs. </li>

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>• When the great Maharana Pratap ascended the throne of Mewar on 28th February 1572 the condition of his nation was in utter disarray. For decades Mewar had fought prolonged wars against the foreign menace which largely depleted its economy, trade organization, social life, and many more.</li>
                <li>• Maharana Pratap immediately started to initiate his tactics to defy the attempt of Mughal emperor Akbar. He shifted his capital from Gogunda to Kumbhalgarh. Later he pumped up his men and loyal nobles to fight for their independence.</li>
                <li>• Another example of his leadership acumen was that Maharana Pratap was the first one who realized the importance of the Bhils, a native tribe who had settled in the southwestern part of Mewar.</li></li>
                <li>• Under his bold and strong leadership, the Mewari Rajputs stood shoulder to shoulder to stop the expansion of the
                    powerful Mughal Empire.</li>

            <h3 class="title text-center font-weight-bold"> PRATAP'S STRUGGLE & STRATEGY TO FIGHT THE HUGE MUGHAL ARMY </h3>
            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>•According to Al Badayuni, who witnessed the battle, the Rana's army counted amongst its ranks 3,000 horsemen and
                    around 400 Bhil archers led by Rana Punja, the Rajput chieftain of Panarwa. No infantry are mentioned. Man Singh's
                    estimated forces numbered around 10,000 men Of these, 4,000 were members of his own clan, the Kachhwas of
                    Jaipur, 1,000 were other Hindu reserves, and 5,000 were Muslims of the Mughal imperial army.</li>
                <li>•First Rana Pratap shifted the civil population of Mewar to Kumbhalgarh and Kelwara. He also used scorched earth
                    tactics to stop the supply lines of the invading army. .</li>
                    <li>• The two armies met on the mountain pass of Haldighati. The battle was tough and ruthless. The outnumbered Mewari
                        Rajputs fought with rare bravery inflicting heavy losses on their opponent. The Mughal army ,although being many
                        times greater in size could neither capture Maharana Pratap nor take over his kingdom. </li>

            <h3 class="title text-center font-weight-bold">AFTERMATH</h3>
            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>• Despite the victory in the battle, Man Singh did not allow the imperial army to chase the retreating Mewar troops and Pratap. According to historian Rima Hooja, this was done by Man Singh because of his personal respect for Pratap.</li>
                <li>• However, Man Singh was reprimanded by Akbar for not capturing Pratap and was suspended from the Mughal court for sometime.While Pratap was able to make a successful retreat, the Mughal troops captured his temporary capital Gogunda, albeit for a short time..</li>
                <li>•Subsequently, Akbar led a sustained campaign against the Rana, and soon most of the Mewar was under his control. Pressure was exerted by the Mughals upon the Rana's allies and other Rajput chiefs, and he was slowly but surely both geographically and politically isolated.</li>
                <li>•The Mughals' focus shifted to other parts of the empire after 1585 CE, which allowed Pratap to recover much of his ancestral kingdom as attested by the contemporaneous epigraphic evidences, which included all 36 outpost of Mewar apart from Chittor and Mandalgarh which continue to remain under the Mughals.</li>
                <li>• By now Mewar enjoyed the peace and it was possible only because of the gallant Maharana Pratap.               </li>

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>• Reportedly, Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident,at Chavand on 19 January 1597, aged 56. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Amar Singh I. On his death bed, Pratap told his son never to submit to the Mughals and to win Chittor back.</li>
